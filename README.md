# AI-Enabled Weed Recognition System

## Project Overview

The **AI-Enabled Weed Recognition System** is an innovative solution designed to tackle one of the most pressing challenges in modern agriculture: efficient and environmentally friendly weed management. Utilizing the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), this system distinguishes between crops and weeds within agricultural fields, paving the way for targeted weed control measures. This approach significantly reduces the need for chemical herbicides, promoting sustainable farming practices and enhancing crop yields.

## Key Features

- **Advanced Weed Recognition:** Harnesses the capabilities of CNN to accurately identify weeds among crops.
- **Environmental Sustainability:** Provides an eco-friendly alternative to conventional herbicide use, mitigating pollution and soil degradation.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Offers a reduction in labor and material costs associated with traditional weed control methods.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** The core programming language for algorithm development and backend processes.
- **Keras & TensorFlow:** Deep learning libraries used for constructing and training the CNN model.
- **OpenCV:** Applied for real-time image processing and analysis.
- **Flask:** Empowers the web interface, showcasing the model's capabilities to users.
