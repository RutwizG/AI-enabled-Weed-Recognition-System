AI-Enabled Weed Recognition System
Introduction
The AI-Enabled Weed Recognition System is a cutting-edge solution designed to tackle one of the most pressing challenges in agriculture: efficient weed detection and differentiation from crops. Developed as part of a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering, this project employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to analyze field images, enabling precise weed recognition without the environmental impact of chemical herbicides.

Features
Weed and Crop Differentiation: Utilizes advanced image processing and CNN to distinguish between crops and weeds accurately.
Environmental Sustainability: Reduces the need for chemical herbicides, lowering the environmental footprint of agricultural practices.
Efficiency and Cost-Effectiveness: Offers a labor-saving and cost-effective solution to manual or chemical weed control methods.
Technologies Used
Python
Keras
TensorFlow
OpenCV for real-time image processing
Flask for creating a web application to demonstrate the model's capabilities
Project Structure
model/: Contains the trained CNN model and scripts for training and evaluation.
app.py: The Flask application for demonstrating the model through a web interface.
templates/: HTML templates for the web application.
static/: Contains CSS and JavaScript files for the web application.
dataset/: Sample dataset directory (not included in the repository due to size constraints).
